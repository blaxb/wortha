  <h3>Account & Profile Data</h3>
  <p>We collect information you provide directly, such as your name, email address, account details, and content you submit to the Service.</p>

  <h2>Cookies & Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in and to analyze usage. Google Analytics is used for usage tracking to help us improve the Service.</p>

  <h2>Payments & Stripe</h2>

  <h2>User Rights</h2>
  <p>You may access, update, or delete your account information at any time through your account settings. If you need help, contact us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
